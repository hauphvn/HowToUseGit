9. branch
When we code a new function, we will create a new branch
We well join into master branch when we have finished that function
The way to create a new branch:
- git checkout -b [branch name]
To come back other branch:
- git checkout [name branch]
To delete a branch
- git branch -D [name branch]
10. merge
Adding changes from other branch to current branch
Example: Merge A branch with B branch
Step 1: You must stay branch A: git checkout A
Step 2: git merge B
